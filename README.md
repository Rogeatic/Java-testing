# Overview

{I want to test another language I haven't used in a while. Java is powerful, and I think I'm pretty rusty right now.}

{I'm basically making a nonsense program in Java, where you enter a name and it does some quick exponential math.}

{The whole point of this is to practice with the syntax.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{I used VS Code and JDK on an M1 Macbook}

{I used plain Java and didn't import anything except Math, which I used for the absolute value function.}

# Useful Websites

{Here's some websites that helped me on this short journey}

- [www.geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-math-abs-method-examples/)
- [Oracle (Java Documentation)](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)

# Future Work

{Here are some things I could do differently.}

- I should change the storage of the number I a exponentiate from int to long because it becomes nagative if too large.
- I could make a way to enter the numbers to pow in the terminal
- There could be some better UI
